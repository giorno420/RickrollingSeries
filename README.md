# Rickrolling Series
The Rickrolling programs I used for my YouTube <a href="https://giornosmp.com/youtube/">videos</a>

### RickRoll.html
This is the most basic one yet. You open the website, the link doesn't look suspiscious, and then you get trapped by the rickroll

### RickRoll.py
This one's the same as the HTML RickRoll page, but its written entirely in Python

### RickRoll.apk
The RickRoll Android app is made using the Kivy android app framework for Python. You download the Android Package (.apk file), run the file, open the app expecting something good, and BAM, you lose all your hopes on the person who sent it to you and immediately rage

### RickRoll.exe
This one's the best one yet. You can rename the file to, welp, basically ANYTHING and no one would think anything. It works exactly like the apk version, but its for Windows, and it deletes itself right after you run it :D

### Rickroll.png
This challenge was the epicest. I made a QR code, which when you scan, redirects you to a rickroll! This by far is the most easiest to use, as no one doubts QR codes :D

**Godmode:** Print this QR code out and stick this at random areas in your city
